<!-- 
PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, 
a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, 
the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code â€“ which may be any type of data, 
such as generated HTML would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. 

This PHP file is for the user logout of the system.
